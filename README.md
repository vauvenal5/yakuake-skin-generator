# yakuake-skin-generator
Generates skin based on Breez (by Andreas Kainz) with correct accent color.

All this script does is create a copy of the Breeze skin and replace the accent color with the one found in the global KDE settings.

It then copies the new skin to .local and restarts Yakuake to apply the new skin.

You can switch between light and dark mode by changing the first parameter in the script.

## Background
I was always annoyed that Yakuake doesn't follow the global accent color set in KDE System Settings.
